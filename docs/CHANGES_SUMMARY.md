# Changes Summary: 52-Week High/Low Data Fix

## Issue

The 52-week high/low data was not displaying properly in the UI, showing as "â€”" even when a valid API key was provided.

## Investigation

1. Added logging to the backend to check the raw Finnhub API responses
2. Created test scripts to directly test the Finnhub API calls
3. Verified whether the 52-week data is actually returned from the API for different symbols

## Changes Made

### Backend

1. Enhanced the stock data service to better handle alternative field names for 52-week high/low data:
   - Added more thorough checking for fields containing "high", "low", "max", "min" combined with "52" or "week"
   - Improved logging to show all potential field candidates
   - Added fallback mechanisms to use alternative fields if standard ones are not available

2. Updated test scripts to:
   - Better handle API key loading from the .env file
   - Print more detailed information about API responses
   - Test multiple stock symbols to check data consistency

3. Created a dedicated `test_multiple_symbols.py` script to:
   - Test batches of symbols
   - Show which symbols have 52-week data available
   - Provide detailed reporting for debugging

### Frontend

1. Improved display of 52-week high/low data in the UI:
   - Enhanced formatting of values when they exist
   - Better handling of missing or null values
   - Fixed number formatting by explicitly converting to Number before calling toFixed()

2. Created clear instructions for API key setup in `SETUP_API_KEY.md`

## Root Cause

The issue could have multiple causes:

1. The Finnhub API might use different field names for 52-week data depending on the stock symbol
2. Some stock symbols might not have 52-week data available in the API
3. Number formatting issues in the frontend when handling certain data types

## Recommendations

1. **API Key**: Ensure a valid Finnhub API key is used and follow the setup instructions in `SETUP_API_KEY.md`

2. **Symbol Selection**: When testing, use major stocks like AAPL, MSFT, or GOOGL which tend to have more complete data

3. **Error Handling**: The application now better handles missing data, but monitor logs for any recurring issues

4. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of Finnhub's rate limits (60 calls/minute for the free tier) when testing with multiple symbols

5. **Data Verification**: Use the provided test scripts to verify data availability before troubleshooting UI issues

## Next Steps

If 52-week data still doesn't display for certain symbols, consider:

1. Running the `test_multiple_symbols.py` script to check which symbols have data available
2. Reviewing the Finnhub API documentation for any changes to their data structure
3. Exploring alternative data sources or endpoints for 52-week high/low data
4. Implementing client-side calculation of 52-week ranges as a fallback using historical data

The changes made should significantly improve the reliability of displaying 52-week high/low data when it's available from the API, while gracefully handling cases where it's not.
