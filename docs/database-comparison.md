# Database Architecture Comparison

## Current Issues with SQLite in Docker
❌ **File locking conflicts** between host and container  
❌ **WAL mode issues** in containerized environments  
❌ **Single writer limitation** blocks import processes  
❌ **Corruption risks** from unclean shutdowns  
❌ **Poor concurrent access** for multiple API calls  

## Recommended Solutions

### 🥇 **Option 1: PostgreSQL on Windows Host**
```
Windows Host: PostgreSQL Server
    ↓ (localhost:5432)
Docker Container: Backend API
```

**Pros:**
✅ **Zero file locking issues**  
✅ **Excellent concurrent performance**  
✅ **Professional database features**  
✅ **Easy backup and maintenance**  
✅ **Scales to production workloads**  

**Cons:**
⚠️ Requires PostgreSQL installation  
⚠️ More complex initial setup  

### 🥈 **Option 2: PostgreSQL in Docker Container**
```
Docker: PostgreSQL Container + Backend Container
```

**Pros:**
✅ **No host software installation needed**  
✅ **Isolated database environment**  
✅ **Easy to replicate setup**  
✅ **Built-in networking**  

**Cons:**
⚠️ Docker volume management  
⚠️ Container dependencies  

### 🥉 **Option 3: Improved SQLite Setup**
```
Windows Host: SQLite file
    ↓ (volume mount)
Docker Container: Backend API (DELETE mode)
```

**Pros:**
✅ **Simple setup**  
✅ **No additional software**  
✅ **Single file database**  

**Cons:**
⚠️ Still has locking issues  
⚠️ Limited concurrent access  
⚠️ Not suitable for heavy imports  

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | SQLite | PostgreSQL |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Concurrent Reads | Limited | Excellent |
| Concurrent Writes | Single | Multiple |
| Import Performance | Slow | Fast |
| Lock Issues | Common | None |
| Memory Usage | Low | Moderate |
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Moderate |
| Production Ready | No | Yes |

## Recommendation

For your stock data application with heavy imports and multiple API endpoints:

**🎯 Use PostgreSQL on Windows Host**

This eliminates all the SQLite locking issues and provides:
- **Fast imports** without blocking other operations
- **Real-time API responses** during data loading
- **Reliable concurrent access** for multiple users
- **Professional database features** for future growth
